Task 2: Natural Language  Processing (NLP) - Text  Classification

üìå Sentiment Analysis Using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes
The objective is to build a text classification model to predict the sentiment (e.g., Positive, Negative, Neutral) of given text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

üîπ Key Steps in the Project
Data Preprocessing

Removed punctuation, special characters, and stopwords.

Converted text to lowercase.

Applied tokenization and lemmatization using NLTK.

Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical features for machine learning models.

Model Training

Trained a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification.

Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using Accuracy Score and Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score).

Achieved robust performance in predicting sentiment categories.
